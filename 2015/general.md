- :tv: [Sebastian Markbage: Minimal API Surface Area | JSConf EU 2014](https://youtu.be/4anAwXYqLG8) - about writing manageable code by using less libraries in favour of pollyfills and standarts, only use abstractions when it would help solve bugs. He talks about writing explicitly repetitive code, which I don't agree 100%.
- [File Caching: Query string vs Last-Modified?](http://stackoverflow.com/a/23604412) - comparing 3 methods - no caching or disabled, using validation (Last-Modified), caching forever (Query string)

- [On Monoliths and Microservices](http://dev.otto.de/2015/09/30/on-monoliths-and-microservices/) - writes about creating scalable applications seperating them in microservices rather then a huge monolithic app. Possible to create different scalabilities - vertical decomposition (apps per sub-domain style - `/api/`, `/store/` etc), distributed computing (individal apps that speak together through some channel), sharding (seperate large data set into smaller one, mostly by creating multiple databases for given range, example a-c, d-f, ..), load balancing (cloan app n times and distribute load beetween them), maximum scalability (combines all of the previously mention solutions).
