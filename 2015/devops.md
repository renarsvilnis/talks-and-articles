- :notebook: [On Monoliths and Microservices](http://dev.otto.de/2015/09/30/on-monoliths-and-microservices/) - writes about creating scalable applications seperating them in microservices rather then a huge monolithic app. Possible to create different scalabilities - vertical decomposition (apps per sub-domain style - `/api/`, `/store/` etc), distributed computing (individal apps that speak together through some channel), sharding (seperate large data set into smaller one, mostly by creating multiple databases for given range, example a-c, d-f, ..), load balancing (cloan app n times and distribute load beetween them), maximum scalability (combines all of the previously mention solutions). There are a list of pros of developing a microservice application.
